        <h1>WHY RE-HOME A DOG?</h1>
        <p>
          Rehoming a dog can provide love and companionship not only for the
          pet, for the adopter itself. Life can be heard sometimes and it can be
          difficult for people to take care of their beloved pets. Re homing a
          dog gives the animal the love and care it needs.
          <br /> <br />
          Moreover, rehoming a pet also opens up space for other animals in
          shelters, making room for them to find their own forever homes. In
          addition, it can also prevent pet overpopulation and reduce the number
          of pets who are homeless. Itâ€™s also a great opportunity for families
          to provide a safe, loving home for a dog in need, which can create a
          lifelong bond between pet and owner.
